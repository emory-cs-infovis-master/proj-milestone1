# Milestone 1: Project Pitch
You will briefly pitch your project idea to the whole class. You should have a dataset picked out that is available online and ready to download immediately. Check Resources on the course webpage for ideas on where to find data sources. For your presentation, you will have just 2 minutes each and no slides - like the proverbial elevator pitch. Just quickly tell the class what dataset you are interested in, why you think it is interesting, and what you have in mind for a visualization project. These pitches will give you (and me) situational awareness of what other people are thinking of and working on. You might find project partners, either because you find somebody else interested in what you care about, or find out that you are more intrigued by a new idea than your previous plan. Communicate with classmates after to form groups of no more than 3 people.

1. **What**: A description of the dataset. What type of dataset is it? What are the items, and what is the primary item type? What are the attributes, and how does their type affect the potential types of visualizations that can be created to explore this dataset?
1. **Why**: A description of the goals and tasks. What are the domain-specific goals? What good can an analysis or presentation of this dataset yield? This should be specified as a few broad questions that relate specifically to the domain. 

A short description of your pitch (250-500 words) is due before class as a submission to Github. In this document, you need to summarize your pitch, including the information requested above. Submit your document as a PDF. For all assignments involving written reports, use Times Roman 11 point type with normal margins, 1.5 line spacing. 

## Note
While there are many fun, fascinating data sources available, I encourage you to pursue datasets that deal with significant social, civic, or environmental concerns.
